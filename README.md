# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNNs

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cifar10-cnn.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `cifar10_cnn.py` script to train the CNN model:

    ```bash
    python cifar10_cnn.py
    ```

2. Once the training is complete, the script will plot the training and validation accuracy curves.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used for this project is as follows:

1. Convolutional Layer with 32 filters and ReLU activation
2. MaxPooling Layer with pool size (2, 2)
3. Convolutional Layer with 64 filters and ReLU activation
4. MaxPooling Layer with pool size (2, 2)
5. Convolutional Layer with 64 filters and ReLU activation
6. Flatten Layer
7. Dense Layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
8. Dense Layer with 10 units (output layer) and softmax activation

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the validation dataset after training for 10 epochs.
